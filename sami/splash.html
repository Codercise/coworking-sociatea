<p>The Coworking Sociatea connects independent workers over coffee and food using the wifi provided by Adelaide City Council and Internode.</p>
<br>
<p>The Coworking Sociatea provides users with data on restaurants, cafes, bars and public spaces that offer Adelaidians the best working environments for them. We use data from Adelaide City Council, Internode, Suburban Councils, Private Enterprise and a range of state and federal departments to give our users information on transport routes, space availability, restaurants/cafe/pub deals and connectivity options to improve collaboration and opportunities.</p>
